17cs3k1,Feeling Lonely Even When Not Alone,"I have people close to me willing to help, but I feel as if there's a barrier between me and them. I have a hard time speaking my true thoughts, thanks to past experiences, and I feel like they don't understand me even when I do.

I feel so alone, and I feel as if I can't rely on anyone for support. This is not because they're not trying, but because I'm just not meeting where they want to... or the other way around.

I honestly don't know if I'm making sense but I've been in one of my lowest points for a while, and I can't help but keep crying every few minutes. I just want someone to talk to without giving me advice or telling me it will be ok.

It's not ok. I don't know if it will ever be ok. I don't even see myself surviving this weekend. But having someone I could talk to and listen to me just plain out would be amazing.

I don't know. Maybe I'm asking too much of people. I just hope I can lick my wounds enough that I have enough energy to fake it again next week.","Feeling Lonely Even When Not Alone ### I have people close to me willing to help, but I feel as if there's a barrier between me and them.

Would like some advice from people with experience with depressed partners. Like so many other, my ex pushed me away and broke up with me.

176e2rg,How am I to survive?,"As long as I was living with my parents, I was able to slowly but surely, work towards overcoming depression. But now, I am finally about to leave home. 

*Now, that my survival is my own responsibility, how am I to use the* ***LITTLE*** *energy that I have, to survive, let alone help my condition?* 

(I hope you guys understand: depression → loss of interest in everything → lack of motivation → little to no energy → almost burnt-out state)

Now, I am to channel my insignificant energy towards earning my livelihood, fuck livelihood, even earning basic needs such as food would be an overstatement. Even then let's consider the best-case scenario, that I barely manage to do so. If that were the case, I would be forever stuck in the endless loop of using all my energy to survive. How would I be able to divert some of my energy towards resolving my issue (depression)?

Any insight from the community would be really helpful.

For this year's Valentine I got him apair of sneakers that I spent a chunk of my salary on and whrn it was time for His gift for me, he told me my gift is just...sex. I was confused but he told me that I should be grateful for it especially since he hasn't been in the mood lately but decided he'd get on it as a gift for me. I was hurt and disappointed because for one he's acting like affection and intimacy is something should be treated as a favor and two, I put money and effort into getting him what he wanted but he obviously didn't even try to do the same for me. things have been tense between us since then. He did similar things in the past and I'm starting to think that he might be a naricissit.","Narcissistic Tendencies?: My husband [Male 34] acts like I should be grateful to be having sex with him. ### Okay, so, I'm not sure if this fits here but here we go.

f0gt3e,I am ending my life tonight,"Tonight, I’m finally ending it all after 21 years of living.  I was neglected by my mother when I was an infant, her neglect and inattentiveness led to me being sexually abused by my caretaker. This has led to many psychological problems such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD and borderline personality disorder. I have wanted to die since I was 6 years old. I see no hope in living anymore. 

I ruin all my relationships. The love of my life broke up with me a month ago. In a state of despair, I hooked up with random men to fill the void. My ex said he would never get back together with me if I slept with other people. I see no point in living. I’m an abusive pile of shit who isn’t capable of being loved because I hurt the people I love most. I have been in therapy for years and I continue to be a fucking monster. 

I ordered refills for medication I have been hoarding. Tonight, I’m going to drive to a place that was special to my ex and I. I am going to end it all tonight. There’s no point in living if my brain will never be fixed. There’s no point in being alive if I’m a terrible human being who never even had a chance. This is my last goodbye.","I am ending my life tonight ### Tonight, I’m finally ending it all after 21 years of living.

mzmt4k,All trauma is trauma!,"**All trauma is trauma.**  


To the brain, anything that is traumatic, or causes hurt or pain, is trauma.  


There is no gauge to say how severe a trauma is.  


Don't invalidate your trauma just because you think that it is not as severe as someone else's trauma. It doesn't work like that.  


All trauma is valid. All trauma is trauma.  


There are so many different types of trauma.  


Emotional neglect with a parent working too much during your childhood.  
Physically abused by a parent.  


Both examples above are trauma to the brain.  


But .. regardless of the trauma, you are not broken. You deserve the same amount of love, joy and happiness as everyone else. And you can get it.  


Stop telling yourself that you are not whole, that you're not worthy and drserving. Tell yourself the opposite and maybe you start to finally believe it.  


Maybe you were emotionally abused or physically abused .. and you have been telling yourself every since that you don't deserve love and affection. And now? .. you believe it right? This is your story. Well, change the story. Identify the story that you've been telling yourself, find the lies in the story .. and make up a new one, a truthful one. One where you are deserving of everything you want and more.","All trauma is trauma! ### **All trauma is trauma.**

tg26l0,I'm surprised at how many mental health professionals don't know how to deal with mentally ill people,"I've been in a lot of mental hospitals and I've seen a lot of sick people and the thing I'm always so surprised at is how incompetent the staff is.

I remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff, and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem. The staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies.

Any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator, and that's understand but also useless. It was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules. Nothing helpful.

Before we decided to separate my night would have been spent taking special care of her. I would have walked on eggshells, rubbed her feet, done everything possible to make her happy. She still would have groused around but I would have moved heaven and earth to make her smile. I would have apologized for getting the soap that doesn't smell nice even though it was on sale. 

Never mind that she almost never did anything like that for me.  Never mind that's how she was most nights the past few years. Worn out, unhappy, unwilling to take care of herself. Tonight I was going to do my husbandly duty and make her happy. 

Then I remembered, she wants a divorce. She doesn't want me to make her happy again. That's not my responsibility anymore. I kept her company, put the kids to bed, but I didn't do anything special for her. 

It was such a relief knowing that I didn't have to spend another night trying in vain to make her feel better. I could take care of myself for once.

14bhax7,The longer I’m divorced the more I dislike my ex husband,"I feel like I deluded myself throughout our 15 year marriage because I needed to believe he was a good person.

Since we separated 2 years ago I’ve realized what a terrible person he is. He tried to take $150k of my parents money, won’t look at me or speak to me when I have to pick up or drop off our child in person, complains to her about me, threatened to call the cops when I went back to our marital home to help declutter so we could sell it, and generally just believes that his wants and needs are more important than anyone else’s.

He really sucks. I’m so glad we’re divorced but I’m not looking forward to coparenting together for the rest of our lives. Ugh.","The longer I’m divorced the more I dislike my ex husband ### I feel like I deluded myself throughout our 15 year marriage because I needed to believe he was a good person.
